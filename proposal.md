# The Cookie Clicker

This program will run a classic cookie clicker style game.

## Features 

The cookie clicker will have both manual clicking and auto clicking features. This will we implemented by using draw and screen functions.


## Challenges

A challenge I will need to research is how to make the screen pop-up interactable with the user.


## Outcomes

### Ideal Outcome

The ideal outcome is that the cookie clicker is fully functional with all the features I want.

### Minimal Viable Outcome


The bare minimum I would like have is for the manual clicker feature to work. Having the base feature that all cookie clicker games have is more important than having and automatic clicker feature.


## Milestones

### Week 1: Have base game implemented

### Week 2: Have auto clicker function working

### Week 3: Debug. If enough time is spared, find ways to enhance the game by either graphics or features
