## Description

This cookie clicker challenges you to eat 100 cookies in less than 15 seconds. Eat 100 or more, you become the Cookie Eating Champion! Don't and you lose the challenge!

For my project I chose to make a simple cookie clicker that challenges the user to click the mouse 100 times in under 15 seconds. I originally was going to have it be a regular cookie clicker with an auto-clicker feature, but I unfortunately was unable to figure out that feature. So instead, I replaced that intended feature with the 100 clicks goal. I was also able to add music, sound fx, particles when the cookie is clicked, and make it so different text appears if the user reaches the goal or not.

In my repository, you may find my commit history a little weird and I will admit that I forgot to commit my work as I was working on the project. I would instead test the code if it worked or not and continue, so for now my history is based on the order I completed adding functions in so you could see how I innovated/added on to my project.

Onto my design choices, I myself drew the cookie using MS Paint to give the game a retro-y/pixel look. The crunch sound fx was free from a sound design website, and the music is from the game "Papa's Freezeria". I choose the particles to be multi-colored to give some more variety in color to the game.

If I were to improve any features I would try again on adding the auto-clicker feature. I would also like to have make a gradient or some sort of hue shifting background so the game doesn't feel as static as it currently does. However, I am really proud of what I was able to accomplish from what I know and features I researched on for the project.
